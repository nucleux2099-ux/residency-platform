Etiology: Idiopathic\n3. **NO SPLANCHNIC VENOUS THROMBOSIS documented**\n4. **CRITICAL FINDING: Portal hypertensive changes (splenomegaly, perisplenic collaterals) WITHOUT SVT**\n5. Portal vein mildly dilated but PATENT (no thrombosis)\n6. SMV and SV not specifically thrombosed\n7. Perisplenic collaterals present but NO vascular occlusion\n8. Portal hypertension likely secondary to CKD and chronic inflammatory state\n9. Complicated by:\n   - Chronic Kidney Disease (not on dialysis)\n   - Severe anemia requiring transfusion\n   - Electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia)\n   - Walled-off necrosis (not amenable to PCD)\n   - History of UGI bleed (Oct 2025)\n10. UGIE confirmed NO varices despite portal hypertensive changes\n11. Discharged in stable condition without anticoagulation\n\n**CRITICAL RESEARCH NOTE:**\nThis patient demonstrates an important distinction - **PORTAL HYPERTENSIVE CHANGES WITHOUT SVT**. Despite having splenomegaly (16 cm) and perisplenic collaterals, NO splanchnic venous thrombosis was documented. This highlights that:\n- Portal hypertension can occur without SVT in pancreatitis\n- CKD and chronic inflammatory states can contribute to portal hypertensive changes\n- Collaterals may develop from causes other than SVT\n- Absence of varices on endoscopy despite collaterals on imaging\n- Young age (22 years) with idiopathic pancreatitis and CKD\n\n---\n\n**Data Collection Date:** 15-January-2026\n**Data Collected By:** Dr Sarath Chandrabhatla\n**Last Updated:** 15-January-2026", "text_chars": 12610, "truncated": false}, "rajesh-deshmukh-961a41c076::956199921efe": {"patient_key": "rajesh-deshmukh-961a41c076", "patient_display_name": "Rajesh Deshmukh", "study_id": "AP-NSVT-009", "case_bucket": "active", "svt_status": "without_svt", "file_id": "956199921efe", "file_name": "Viral Markers.pdf", "relative_path": "02-Data-Collection/Active-Cases/Acute Pancreatitis Cases without SVT/Rajesh Deshmukh/Viral Markers.pdf", "category": "attachment", "mime_type": "application/pdf", "extension": ".pdf", "updated_at": "2026-01-15T11:42:50.019903+00:00", "size_bytes": 843271, "signature": "843271:1768477370019903139", "status": "indexed", "error": null, "extractor": "marker", "indexed_at": "2026-02-18T18:16:41.663535+00:00", "text": "![](_page_0_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n# Department of Microbiology\n\n**Regional Virology Laboratory**\n\n**ABHA NO** : **ABHA ADDRESS** : rajeshdeshmukh2082@abdm\n\n**CR No** : 239212501755710 **Lab/Study No.** : 250630RVL00191 **Coll./Study Date** : 30-Jun-25 20:59\n\n**Patient Name** : Rajesh Deshmukh **Age/Sex** : 28 Yr/M **Acceptance Date** : 01-Jul-25 00:49\n\n**Sample Type/No** : Blood\n\nSerum/250630RVL00191\n\n**Ward** : Kokila C Ward **Reporting Date** : 03-Jul-25 09:41\n\n**Dept/Unit** : Emergency Medical Unit 1 EMU\n\n**Room/Bed** : Trauma And E M Ward Room/Bed 31\n\n| Investigation                           | Result                           | Unit                                            | Ref.

Routine Labs were send (CBC \u2013 Hb \u2013 8.2, TLC \u2013 8030, Plt \u2013 3.5L ,Urea/Creat \u2013 10/0.79 , Na/K \u2013 135/4.3 , Bil\u2013 0.69/0.20 , SGOT /SGPT \u2013 23/10 ALP/GGT \u2013 236/191 , PT/INR \u2013 14/1.21, Prot/alb \u2013 6.6/3.1 Viral Markers \u2013 Non Reactive), Gastrosurgery reference was received from TEM, and advice was given. CECT abdomen (30/06/25) showed pneumoperitoneum and ANP. In view of bowel perforation, patient was shifted to SGE HDU on next day. After taking high risk consent, he underwent emergency sx on 1st July 2025. Intra op period was uneventful; was intubated and shifted to SICU with ionotropic support. He was extubated on POD 2 and he had serous discharge from main wound. He had purulent high output from all the 3 drains in immediate post-op which gradually decreased in volume from POD 6. He was started on fluconazole in view of growth of yeast in ET aspirate and urine culture. He developed b/l pleural effusion and was managed conservatively after pulmo cx. His RT output started decreasing from POD 6, stoma became functional and was started on FJ feed trial, which he tolerated. He was shifted to SGE HDU on POD 6. He started having peridrain feculent soakage over the right ADK and later feculent output from right ADK. CECT was done, and it confirmed a leak of contrast through the colon repair site. The leak was contained, was managed conservatively; He developed wound dehiscence on POD 7 with purulent discharge and was managed conservatively. Cotrimoxazole and Vancomycin were started from POD 8 based on cultures. RT was removed on POD 8 and orals was started and increased as per tolerance. Left perisplenic drain removed on POD 11. Left pelvic drain was removed on POD 20. In view of anaemia despite multiple blood transfusions, a hematology cx was taken on POD 26 and advice was followed. He had elevated counts on POD 27 ( TLC-14590), along with persistent purulent discharge from right ADK; antibiotics was upgraded to piptaz and CT was done on POD 31; showed persistent defect in colon and multiple peripancreatic collections. On POD 39, CT guided pigtail was placed into peripancreatic collection, and thick pus was drained. He started having persistent hyponatremia and was managed conservatively. During hospital course, patient managed with iv & oral antibiotics (cefaperazone sulbactum, piperacillin tazobactum, meropenem, metronidazole, Cotrimoxazole, Fluconazole, Vancomycin, levofloxacin), iv PPI, iv antipyretics, Iv antiemetics, iv diclofenac, symptomatic & supportive care.

26-Dec-2024 12:20\n\nCASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol consumption for 15 years (last intake on 19/11/24) presented\nwith a 20-day history of abdominal pain localized to the left hypochondrium. The pain was not associated with yellowish discoloration\nof the eyes/skin, fever, pedal edema, passage of loose stools, or altered sensorium.The patient had been hospitalized elsewhere for 7\ndays and was diagnosed with acute necrotizing pancreatitis with a parenchymal collection measuring 177 \ufffd\ufffd 65 mm and left-sided\npleural effusion (likely reactive). He left against medical advice (LAMA) and subsequently presented to our center.IVR consultation was\nsought for drainage of the walled-off necrosis.

CD Grade 0.\nOTHER INVESTIGATIONS: CECT Abdomen (12/12/24, Outside):Pancreas is diffusely enlarged with large necrotic collection in the\nparenchyma measuring 177x 65 mm. No e/o gas loculi within.Peripancreatic fat stranding with surrounding free fluid seen?\nNecrotizing Pancreatitis. There is presence of focal area of mesenteric fat stranding and inflammation surrounding the superior\nmesenteric vessels and regional subcentimetre sized Lymphadenopathy s/o Mesenteric paninculitis.\nCECT Abdomen + Thorax (20/12/25, AIIMS): Pancreas: A large, well-defined, peripherally enhancing heterogeneously hypodense\ncollection (walled off necrosis) is noted at neck, body and tail region as described: It measures 12x6.8x7.5 cm. Anteriorly, the\ncollection is seen extending into lesser sac and abutting the lesser curvature of stomach. Superiorly, it is reaching till inferior surface\nof liver, however clear fat planes are maintained. Posteriorly, it is causing mass effect on the splenic vein, causing severely reduced\nluminal caliber, however normal contrast opacification is noted. This collection is showing few extensions laterally, and is seen to\ninvolve the perisplenic region. Another similar loculated collection, measuring 14x10x7.4 cm is seen in left subdiaphragmatic space\nshowing communication with above mentioned collection. This collection is abutting the superior surface of the spleen. Adjacent\nmesenteric fat stranding seen. Pancreatic duct is not visualized.Rest of the head and uncinate process of pancreas show reduced\nenhancement, post contrast. Common hepatic artery is seen to be arising from SMA, not from coeliac artery- suggesting replaced\ncommon hepatic artery. Splenic artery and GDA appears normal in caliber and shows normal contrast opacification, with no e/o\nluminal irregularities or focal outpouching. Severe luminal attenuation of splenic vein, spleno-portal confluence is noted, however\nnormal contrast opacification is seen. Mild amount of free fluid is noted involving bilateral paracolic gutters and pelvic cavity. Thin\nrim of perihepatic free fluid is also noted.\nTHORAX: Gross amount of free fluid is noted in left pleural cavity, for a maximum thickness of 5cm with collapse of LUL (sparing\nanterior and lingular segment) and near complete collapse/consolidation of LLL. It is also causing mass effect in the form of\nmediastinal shift towards right side and trans-mediastinal herniation of medial lingula. Minimal amount of right sided pleural\neffusion is noted (maximum thickness-10mm). Few para-septal emphysematous changes are noted involving apical segments of RUL\nand anterior segment of LUL.\nCECT (12/9/2025 AIIMS): Pancreas: A large, well-defined, peripherally enhancing heterogeneously hypodense collection (walled off\nnecrosis) is noted at body and tail region as described: It measures 8.6 x 4.5 x 5.7 cm in maximum orthogonal dimensions (previously\n12x6.8x7.5 cm) Anteriorly, the collection is seen extending into lesser sac and abutting the lesser curvature of stomach. Posteriorly,\nit is causing mass effect with severe luminal attenuation of splenic vein due to compression by the collection in body and tail region\nof pancreas, however normal contrast opacification is seen. The extension of this collection into the splenic parenchyma is noted.\nSimilar, collection measuring approx. (3.9 x 2.4 x 3) cm sized seen in perisplenic and left subdiaphragmatic region along the superior\nsurface of spleen [previously measuring 14x10x7.4 cm sized]. Adjacent minimal fat stranding seen. Pancreatic duct is not visualized.\nRest of the head and uncinate process of pancreas show normal post contrast enhancement.\nSpleen- normal in size, shape, and shows multiple ill-defined hypodense non enhancing collections in the splenic parenchyma\nshowing communication with the above-mentioned collections.

Etiology: Alcohol (15-year history, abstinent since December 2024)\n3. **NO SPLANCHNIC VENOUS THROMBOSIS documented**\n4. **CRITICAL FINDING: Splenic vein COMPRESSION (not thrombosis) by WOPN for 9 months WITHOUT SVT development**\n5. Normal contrast opacification of splenic vein maintained despite severe luminal attenuation\n6. Portal vein and SMV explicitly documented as PATENT\n7. Complicated course with:\n   - Large WOPN (sterile)\n   - Massive left pleural effusion with pancreatico-pleural fistula (resolved)\n   - Respiratory failure requiring ICD (resolved)\n   - Chronic analgesic dependence (resolved post-surgery)\n8. Successful elective surgery: Necrosectomy + Cystogastrostomy\n9. **No collaterals found at surgery** despite chronic SV compression\n10. Uneventful postoperative recovery (Clavien-Dindo Grade 0)\n11. Discharged in stable condition without anticoagulation\n\n**CRITICAL RESEARCH NOTE:**\nThis patient demonstrates an important distinction between **SPLENIC VEIN COMPRESSION** (mechanical, extrinsic) versus **SPLENIC VEIN THROMBOSIS** (intraluminal clot). Despite 9 months of severe compression with luminal attenuation, normal contrast opacification was maintained throughout, indicating NO THROMBOSIS. This highlights that:\n- Compression alone does NOT necessarily lead to thrombosis\n- Maintained blood flow (normal contrast opacification) prevents clot formation\n- No portal hypertension developed despite chronic SV compression\n- Sterile WOPN may have lower thrombotic risk than infected collections\n- No anticoagulation needed for compression without thrombosis\n- Surgical resolution of WOPN expected to relieve compression\n\n---\n\n**Data Collection Date:** 15-January-2026\n**Data Collected By:** Dr Sarath Chandrabhatla\n**Last Updated:** 15-January-2026", "text_chars": 13744, "truncated": false}, "mausmi-bagri-4b38379a07::db05a9991570": {"patient_key": "mausmi-bagri-4b38379a07", "patient_display_name": "Mausmi Bagri", "study_id": "AP-NSVT-003", "case_bucket": "active", "svt_status": "without_svt", "file_id": "db05a9991570", "file_name": "Discharge.cnt.pdf", "relative_path": "02-Data-Collection/Active-Cases/Acute Pancreatitis Cases without SVT/Mausmi Bagri/Discharge.cnt.pdf", "category": "discharge", "mime_type": "application/pdf", "extension": ".pdf", "updated_at": "2025-11-24T19:26:33.346481+00:00", "size_bytes": 598738, "signature": "598738:1764012393346480506", "status": "indexed", "error": null, "extractor": "marker", "indexed_at": "2026-02-18T19:01:09.136876+00:00", "text": "![](_page_0_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n# Department : Surgical Gastroenterology Death Summary\n\n| CR No.: 239212502565752        | Name: Mausmi Bagri Bagri                                                  | Age/Gender: 23 Yr/F                   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Admission No.: 239212025052572 | Department Unit: Surgical Gastroenterology (Surgical<br>Gastroenterology) | Consultant/Faculty: Dr Vishal Gupta   |\n| Ward: Gastro Surgery HDU       | Room/Bed: Gastro Surgery HDU/ HDU Bed 2                                   | Patient Category: Ayushman Bharat     |\n| Discharge Type: Death          | Father/Spouse Name: /Devendra Bagri                                       | Occupation:                           |\n| Contact No.: 7024875742        | Address: H,,H,Bhopal                                                      | State/Country Madhya<br>Pradesh/India |\n| D.O.A. : 28-Aug-2025 15:52     | D.O.D. : 20-Sep-2025                                                      | D.O.

For these complaints pt consulted in AIIMS emergency (TEM) where he was admitted & evaluated with labs & imaging &\nwas found to have acute cholecystitis. Pt was then assessed by SGE team & was admitted for further management. H/O yellowish\ndiscolouration of urine x 1 day. No fever/GI bleed/abdominal distension. H/O similar illness in 2023, evaluated with USG & MRCP\nwhich revealed circumferential smooth GB wall thickening & was managed conservatively. Pt is a K/C/O hypothyroidism on treatment\nwith T. Thyroxine. No addictions/allergy.\nCASE SUMMARY: Pt is conscious, well oriented to time, place & person, afebrile. Icterus +\nPR- 84/min, BP- 132/84mm Hg, SpO2- 97%\nP/A - soft, tenderness + over right hypochondrium & epigastrium, not distended.\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Pt is hemodynamically stable, afebrile, tolerating orals, passing stools, P/A soft, non tender & hence\nbeing discharged in stable condition. Advised to collect CRP, RFT, LFT, Amylase, lipase, TPOAb reports.\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\nAcute cholecystitis\n\n\nAcute biliary pancreatitis (mild)\n\n\nGB sludge\n\n\nObstructive jaundice;\nRemarks: no CBD stone\n\n\nHypothyroidism;\n\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Pt was admitted for above mentioned complaints. Necessary blood investigations were done (TLC- 6520, Hb- 13.3,\nPlt- 1.27L, CRP- 4.08, TB/DB- 5.34/2.89, AST/ALT- 513/544, ALP/GGT- 344/953, Amylase/Lipase- 3110/8086). USG W/A was done\n(28/7/25) which showed distended GB showing mild diffuse wall thickness with GB sludge; MRCP was advised for CBD evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                              Page No: 1\n\n                                                                                            CR: 239212200390481\n\n\n\n\nMRCP (28/7/25) showed GB wall edema (upto 9 mm) with sludge. mildly dilated CBD/CHD (upto 9.5mm) throughout its course with\nabrupt tapering at ampulla with mild soft tissue edema at periampullary region, no filling defects. Mild diffusely bulky pancreas with\nmild peripancreatic fluid. Gastromedicine consultation was done & advise followed (Hep A & E IgM done-both negative). Repeat labs\nshowed improving LFT and pancreatic enzymes (TB/DB- 2.28/0.97, AST/ALT- 242/431, ALP/GGT- 334/888, Amy/lip- 895/1827). Oral sips\nwere started on 29/7/25, following which pt developed severe abdominal pain & discomfort for (1 day) which required multiple\nanalgesics. CECT chest & abdomen was done on 30/7/25 which showed moderate diffuse GB wall thickening with edematous wall\n(max 8mm) with minimal pericholecystic fluid, prominent CBD, bulky pancreas with fuzzy margins with minimal surrounding free\nfluid, minimal ascites & left pleural effusion. Repeat labs showed TLC- 6140, Hb- 11.9, Plt- 1.2L, TB/DB- 1.74/0.75, AST/ALT- 313/446,\nALP/GGT- 402/982, U/Cr- 24/0.97, Na/K- 136/3.41, CRP- 20.39, TG- 65, HDL/LDL- 43/111, VLDL- 13, calcium- 8.29). Oral feed gradually\nresumed and gradually increased as per tolerance. Endocrinology consultation was done for hypothyroidism & advise followed\n(Thyroxine dose increased). PMR consultation was done & advise followed. Labs were repeated which showed normal CBC (TLC- 4920,\nHb- 12.8, Plt- 1.58L), improving LFTs (TB/DB- 1.59/0.55, AST/ALT- 161/304, ALP/GGT- 317/804) and increased CRP (69). Pt was managed\nconservatively with IVF, iv antibiotics (cefoperazone-sulbactum), PPI, analgesics, antiemetics and other symptomatic and supportive\ntreatment. Patient responded to conservative management with improving jaundice and resolved abdominal pain. During stay\npatient remained hemodyanimically stable with no fever, adequate urine output, & no O2 requirement. Currently pt is\nhemodynamically stable, afebrile, tolerating orals, passing stools, P/A soft, non-tender & hence being discharged in stable condition.\nAdvised to collect LFT, amylase, lipase, RFT & CRP reports & to review in OPD. Plan: USG abdomen after 2 weeks. Interval\ncholecystectomy.\nOTHER INVESTIGATIONS: USG W/A on 25/7/25: Gr 1 fatty liver. Rest normal.\nUSG HPB on 28/7/25: GB distended, wih mild diffuse wall thickening with maintained stratification. Sludge + CBD could not be\nassessed.\nMRCP done on 28/7/25: GB wall edema (upto 9mm) with sludge.

Print Report: 11-Jan-2026 12:45\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINTS:\nAbdominal pain for 2 weeks\nVomiting for 2 weeks\nLoose stools for 3 days\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a follow up case of acute necrotizing pancreatitis who was admitted, evaluated and\nmanaged in the department of SGE AIIMS Bhopal from 1-8-2025 to 4-9-2025. He had gastric outlet obstruction secondary to\nperipancreatic collection/pseudocyst compression in the previous admission, for which he underwent UGIE which showed mucosal\nedema at antrum and NJ placement for the same. Aspiration was also done from the pancreatic head collection (around 6ml purulent\ncontent), following which he had symptomatic relief and NJ was removed at discharge. Patient was apparently alright 2 weeks back\nwhen he developed pain in abdomen over the epigastric region, radiating to back, following alcohol intake. He was admitted in\nprivate hospital between 27/11/25 and 3/12/25; 3/12/25 and 14/12/25 (had one episode of UGI bleed) and took LAMA. During\nevaluation, USG (27/11/25) showed acute on chronic pancreatitis and CT abdomen (3/12/25) showed coarse enlarged liver with\nhepatitis, atrophic pancreas). He presented to AIIMS currently with complaints of abdominal pain for 20 days associated with\nvomiting (watery)- last episode 2 days back, non bilious, aggravated with meals, associated with hiccups, temporarily relieved with\nmedications. History of loss of appetite present. History of loose stools around 2 to 3 times per day for 3 days. No history of\nabdominal distension. No history of fever, jaundice ,oliguria, cough/breathlessness. He consumes alcohol occasionally. No known\nmedical comorbidities or known allergies.\nCASE SUMMARY: Patient conscious, oriented to time, place and person.\nFairly nourished. No Edema/LN/clubbing/pallor/icterus are present.\nWeight- 74 kg ,height- 148 cm, BMI- 33.8 kg/m2,\nPR-72/min, BP- 120/80 mmhg, RR- 20, Spo2- 98%.\nP/A- tenderness present at epigastric region, vague lump present in the epigastric region, no guarding/ rigidity, no scar present, no\nascites or organomegaly.\nPR - no malena, normal stool staining\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Currently patient is hemodynamically stable, ambulatory, afebrile, tolerating orals, passing flatus and\nmotion, abdomen soft, non -tender and hence being discharged in stable condition.\n\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\nRecurent acute on chronic pancreatitis (alchohol induced)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                  Page No: 1\n\n                                                                                             CR: 239212502434968\n\n\n\n\nGall bladder sludge\n\n\nperisplenic WON\n\n\nSepsis\n\n\nAcute hepatitis (resolved)\n\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted in SGE ward for further management. Necessary blood investigations were done (Hb-13.5\nTLC-16990, Plt-1.47L, CRP-194, Urea/Creat-19/0.58, T/D bilirubin-0.28/0.24, AST/ALT-16/11, ALP/GGT-89/34, TP/Alb-6.7/2.9, PT/INR-\n15.8/1.31, S.Na-130 S.K-4.38. Started empirically on injection Meropenem at admission and completed a 14-day course. Had a\ntransient episode of watery vomiting for one day; following which started on clear liquids and gradually increased as per tolerance.\nGastromedicine opinion was taken for UGIE in v/o h/o UGI bleed which showed small hiatus hernia and stomach, duodenum normal.\nUrgent VIR opinion was taken on 19/12/25 for drainage of peripancreatic infected collection in view of sepsis. USG abdomen\n(17/12/25) showed collection in pancreatic tail region (45cc) and USG guided aspiration of 60ml purulent fluid was done and was sent\nfor c/s (sterile), DFA (12.5). Patient symptomatically improved partially following intervention. Fibroscan done on 20/12/25 showed F0\nfibrosis. CECT abdomen done on 24/12/25 showed large collection in pancreatic tail region (4.4 x 3.4 x 10 cm) with extension into\nperisplenic area (7.8 x 3.2 x 6.5cm). VIR opinion was taken for PCD insertion into the perisplenic collection due to persistent\nsymptoms, USG guided pigtail catheter (12fr) was inserted into the perisplenic collection. Pigtail output was purulent in nature\naround 20 to 40ml daily (around 100 to 200ml for 2 days in between). DFA-7. Fungal culture showed no growth. Patient had\npersistent increased TLC count (17,260). He was started on Inj Pip-taz and Inj Metronidazole, given for 5 days showed decreased TLC\n(11120). VIR review was sought for residual collection. USG (29/12/25) showed collection in perisplenic region measuring 7.5x1.9cm\nwith pigtail insitu. On 4/1/26 his abdominal pain increased with fresh bleeding (around 100ml) in the PCD; PCD was clamped, pt\nremained hemodynamically stable. Urgent CT angiogram done showed no evidence of bleed or pseudoaneurysm. Hb 11.8 -> 10.5,\nINR 1.19. No fall in Hb noted and he was hemodynamically stable throughout. PCD output turned purulent with blood tinge around\n10 to 20ml. VIR review for residual collection reassessment with previous CECT abdomen showed significant decrease in perisplenic\ncollection and advised pigtail removal. His symptoms improved significantly. Pigtail was removed on 10/1/26 (nil output). Psychiatry\nopinion was taken i/v/o alcohol deaddiction and advised Tab Baclofen 20mg. During hospital course, patient managed with IV\nantibiotics (Meropenem, Piptaz, Metronidazole, IVF, PPI, analgesics, antiemetics, prokinetics, and other symptomatic & supportive\ncare. Labs on discharge: Hb- 10.5, TLC- 9260, PLT-1,94,000. CRP- 49, LFT- WNL, RFT- WNL. Currently patient is hemodynamically stable,\nambulatory, afebrile, tolerating orals, passing flatus and motion, abdomen soft, non tender and hence being discharged in stable\ncondition.\nOTHER INVESTIGATIONS: MRCP 25/09/25 AIIMS: Non-dilated biliary system.

The anterior pyloric collection causes compression and luminal narrowing of gastric outlet - gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), with suspicious communication of MPD with the collection with dilated distal MPD. ll-defined hypodensity with surrounding fat stranding at pancreatic neck and posterior wall of pylorus. \u25cf\n- Currently to assess the status of the collection and the pancreatic duct.\n\n# OBSERVATIONS:\n\n- Pancreas: Mild enlargement and altered T2 FS hyperintense signal of the pancreatic head, with mild peri-pancreatic fat stranding noted. There is non visualization of pancreatic duct in this region with upstream dilatation of pancreatic duct in the body and tail of pancreas. The pancreatic duct in the uncinate process is visualized and normal in caliber. No evidence of anomalous pancreatico-biliary junction/long common channel.No obvious mass/soft tissue lesion is seen in the peri ampullary region. \u25cf\n- Small, ill defined, lobulated T2/T2 FS intermediate to hypointense soft tissue is seen in the right transverse mesocolon measuring 27x21mm, anterior to the pylorus-suggestive of residual necrotic collection. No obvious ductal communication. \u25cf\n- Gall bladder: is distended. No evidence of any T2 hypointense filling defects within the lumen. The cystic duct shows low medial insertion into the common hepatic duct. \u25cf\n- CBD: is of normal caliber, showing smooth distal tapering towards ampulla with no evidence of T2 hypointense filling defect noted. \u25cf\n\n**All reports need clinical correlation.

No focal liver lesion noted. \u25cf\n- Spleen: is normal in size, measures ~9.6 cm in cranio-caudal dimension. No focal lesion noted. \u25cf\n- Bilateral kidneys appear normal in size and signal intensity. No evidence of hydroureteronephrosis noted. \u25cf\n\n# IMPRESSION: MRCP reveals:\n\n- Non-dilated biliary system.\n- Mild enlargement and altered signal of the pancreatic head- likely represents focal pancreatitis. There is non visualization of pancreatic duct in this region with upstream dilatation of pancreatic duct in the body and tail of pancreas. The pancreatic duct in the uncinate process is visualized and normal in caliber. \u25cf\n- Small lobulated soft tissue is seen in the right transverse mesocolon measuring ~27x21mm suggestive of residual necrotic collection.

After initial conservative management he developed WOPN which required step-up endoscopic intervention, he was assessed on 30/10/25 with UGIE and was planned for EUS CG on 19/11/25. EUS CG and LAMS placement was performed on 19/11/25 and drained 500ml dirty brown fluid f/b 2 sessions of DEN (28/11 and 3/12) . During the same admission from 3/12/25 - 8/12/25, patient developed AKI and severe sepsis which recovered over time under ICU management. Post recovery he developed abdominal distension with septated ascites (purulent on aspiration).Ncct imaging with oral contrast done on 7/12/25: Pneumoperitoneum? Suspected duodenal perforation. No known comorbidities, addictions or allergies. No past surgical history.\n\nCASE SUMMARY: GC: poor. Edema present No LN/clubbing/pallor/icterus are present. Weight- 61.7 kg ,height- 173 cm, BMI- 20.6 kg/m2 ,PR-66/min BP- 129/69 mmhg RR- 20 Spo2- 98% .On examination-Chest- B/L air entry present ,P/A\u2013 soft, gaseous distention present, tenderness present, no guarding/rigidity . No ascites/scars.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Patient expired on 23-12-2025 at 4.30 pm\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted in TEM with the above mentioned complaints and routine blood investigations were done.( Hb-8.7 TLC-14700, Plt-2.2L, urea/creat-77/1.13 AST/ALT-49/22 , ALP/GGT-,TP/Alb-5.36/2.43PT/INR 13/1.09 T/D bilirubin 0.79/0.61 S.Na 142 S.K 4.99& viral markers tested negative). Gastrosurgery opinion was taken and advice was given. He was later transferred to SGE ward on 13-12-205. He was started on iv antibiotics, RT was kept on continuous drainage and was planned for CECT Abdomen. CECT was done on 17-12-2025 and was suggestive of sealed off perforation. USG doppler was done in view of b/l pedal edema and revealed right LL SFT and was started on heparin as per CTVS advice. He was planned for emergency laparotomy in view persistent undrained collections, however was deferred in view of absence of A negative blood component in blood bank. VIR opinion was taken and USG guided pigtail was placed into peritoneal cavity and it drained around 4l of purulent ascites along with hemorrhagic fluid. After informed consent and high risk consent he underwent emergency Exploratory laparotomy with drainage of intra abdominal collections and hemoperitoneum with evacuation of clots adhesiolysis with peritoneal lavage on 19-12-2025. Intraop he was started on ionotrope and required high dose nor adr for maintain BP, along with blood transfusion. Plan for necrosectomy and FJ was abandoned in view of hypotension and patient was shifted intubated with ionotropic support to SICU. Postoperative labs Hb-9.5 TLC-11870, Plt-46000, urea/creat-77/1.13 AST/ALT-49/22 , ALP/GGT-,TP/Alb-5.36/2.43PT/INR 13/1.09 T/D bilirubin 0.79/0.61 S.Na 142 S.K 4.99. Hematology opinion was taken for thrombocytopenia. One unit RDAP was transfused on POD 2. He was extubated on POD 2 and was shifted to SGE HDU on POD3. RT output decreased and he was started on RT feeds from POD 3 which he tolerated. Platelets\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\ncontinued to fall in the post operative day 3 and 4 (25,000). On POD4, patient started having tachypnoea and required oxygen support. Despite high flow oxygen support, he was not maintaining saturation and SICU opinion was taken for intubation. He was later shifted to SICU on 23-12-2025 and was intubated and kept on ventilator with FiO2 requirement of 100%. He was also started on Nadr. At 4 pm, he arrested and CPR was given according to ATLS protocol. However couldn't be revived and was later declared dead at 4.30 pm. During hospital course, patient managed with, iv antibiotics( meropenem, metronidazole, fluconazole) iv PPI, iv antipyretics, Iv antiemetics, iv diclofenac, symptomatic & supportive care.\n\nOTHER INVESTIGATIONS: CT Abdomen (9/9/25, outside):Liver is mild enlarged in size measuring approximately 16.9 cm with decreased parenchymal density suggestive of mild hepatomegaly with fatty infiltration ofliver.

On 19-Dec-2025\n\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Approx ~2.8L hemorrhagic purulent ascitic fluid drained. Multiple old blood clots (~500 CC) evacuated, mainly from right lower quadrant around PCD entry point (? PCD insertion trauma) & some blood clots from left lower quadrant. No other obvious source of bleeding identified. Thick purulent collection with clots in right iliac fossa and pelvis. Rt subphrenic collection present ~ 500 ml- purulent, hemorrhagic, with a lot of pus flakes over entire liver surface. No obvious bile/ enteric leak/staining seen Thickened & edematous stomach, LAMS could not be localised. Extensive intraabdominal adhesions between stomach, liver, omentum, intestine and parietal wall. Greater omentum thickened, densely adhered to underlying small bowel & transverse colon up to pelvis & forming a cocoon & obscuring inframesocolic compartment & entire small bowel. Thick pus seen coming out from one point in the interbowel space in the left lower abdomen, possibly communicating with the peripancreatic WON collection- cavity drained and irrigated. Small bowel could not be delineated completely due to dense interbowel adhesions. Peritoneal lavage done in all quadrants. PCD removed. PCD entry site was closed inside with prolene 2-0. Small serosal small bowel repaired with silk 3-0. Planned feeding jejunostomy deferred as small bowel was inaccessible due to adhesions and cocoon-like abdomen. Necrosectomy and stent removal also deferred due to intraoperative hemodynamic instability with increasing inotropic support.\n\nDISCHARGE BY : Dr Vishal Gupta\n\nDISCHARGE REMARKS :\n\nCAUSE OF DEATH : Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome\n\nDATE OF DEATH : 23-Dec-2025\n\nSummary Prepared By Summary Approved By\n\nDr Maidh Pavneet Singh Dr Vishal Gupta", "text_chars": 11406, "truncated": false}, "yasin-khan-9d2126b2c0::aa05510b9a0f": {"patient_key": "yasin-khan-9d2126b2c0", "patient_display_name": "Yasin Khan", "study_id": "AP-SVT-006", "case_bucket": "active", "svt_status": "with_svt", "file_id": "aa05510b9a0f", "file_name": "Bacteriology.pdf", "relative_path": "02-Data-Collection/Active-Cases/Acute Pancreatitis cases with SVT/Yasin Khan/Bacteriology.pdf", "category": "imaging", "mime_type": "application/pdf", "extension": ".pdf", "updated_at": "2026-01-15T09:23:02.285928+00:00", "size_bytes": 161213, "signature": "161213:1768468982285928488", "status": "indexed", "error": null, "extractor": "marker", "indexed_at": "2026-02-18T20:16:40.644278+00:00", "text": "![](_page_0_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nDepartment of Microbiology\n\n**Bacteriology**\n\n**ABHA NO** : - **ABHA ADDRESS** : -\n\n**CR No** : 239212503623306 **Lab/Study No.** : 251215MM018 **Coll./Study Date** : 15-Dec-25 18:31\n\n**Patient Name** : Yasin Khan **Age/Sex** : 57 Yr/M **Acceptance Date** : 15-Dec-25 19:20\n\n**Sample Type/No** : Pus/251215MM018 **Ward** : Gastro Surgery **Reporting Date** : 15-Dec-25 21:50\n\nHdu\n\n**Dept/Unit** : Surgical Gastroenterology\n\n**Room/Bed** : Gastro Surgery Hdu/Hdu Bed 1\n\nInvestigation Result Unit Ref.

It was severe, continuous, radiating to back and also associated with nausea and multiple episodes of vomiting, both gastric and bilious. For this, he consulted at Rudra Hospital for 15 days (April 18th - April 30th 2025) where he was managed conservatively. Later in view of persistent symptoms he got admitted at another private hospital where he was investigated with CECT and also underwent pleural tapping for effusion. He had mild symptom relief and was referred to AIIMS Bhopal. He was admitted in AIIMS Bhopal (General surgery) from 19th June to July 1st. He was managed conservatively, was started on ATT after pulmonary medicine opinion in view of cytology findings in pleural fluid aspirate. He was later discharged and attached to SGE and VIR OPD. He underwent 2 PCD placement into epigastric collection on which was later removed on OPD basis. He continued to have pain abdomen and hence was admitted in SGE ward. No H/o jaundice / fever spikes. H/o passage of dark coloured stool (+) constipation (+). No H/o DM / HTN. Dry cough (+) SOB (+). On ATT since 2 months for suspected pulmonary TB. Personal History: Mixed diet, sleep adequate, addiction - alcohol, tobacco chewing since 20 years. No known allergies.\n\nCASE SUMMARY: Patient conscious oriented to time, place and person ,fairly nourished .No Edema/LN/clubbing/pallor/icterus are present. Weight- 41.3 kg ,height- 158 cm, BMI- 16.5 kg/m2 ,PR-92/min BP- 120/84 mmhg RR- 20 Spo2- 98% .On examination-Chest-B/L air entry present ,P/A- mild epigastric tenderness +.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Patient is currently being hemodynamically stable, tolerating soft diet, passing stool and flatus and is being discharged in stable condition. PCD in situ draining - 100-150 ml/day; Right ICD in situ draining 10 ml/day, column movement+\n\nAcute severe necrotising pancreatitis\n\nMultiple walled off necrosis\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n\nS/P multiple PCD placements into WON(30/6/25, 8/8/2025, 20/8/2025)\n\nB/L Pancreaticopleural fistula\n\nRight sided pyothorax\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nS/P right pleural cavity pigtail( 10/9/2025)\n\nDisconnected pancreatic duct syndrome\n\nExternal pancreatic fistula\n\nCholelithiasis;\n\nSplenic vein thrombosis;\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the SGE ward with the above-mentioned complaints. Routine tests were done (Hb: 8.8, TLC: 9490, TB/DB: 0.49/0.19, AST/ALT: 236/54, ALP: 92, CRP: 30 amylase-). He was kept NPO, started on levofloxacin and VIR opinion was taken for drainage of intraabdominal collection which was drained under CT guidance on 8/8/2025, 14 Fr pigtail placed into the collection in left paracolic gutter. Fluid had very high amylase- 3957, & was sterile. He had symptomatic improvement and was started on oral diet. He had b/l pleural effusion and underwent diagnostic pleural tapping on 11/8/2025 and its showed elevated amylase levels in both sides (Right- 3090; left- 556). On 12/8/205 he had recurrent pain abdomen and multiple episodes of vomiting. He was kept NPO, started on octreotide, and MGE opinion was taken for NJ placement. NCCT abdomen was done on 16/8/2025 and showed collection near pancreatic head. On 20/8/2025 NJ placement was done. He was shifted to HDU in view of respiratory distress. C xray revealed gross b/l pleural effusion; pulmonary opinion was taken and therapeutic pleural tapping was done on 22/8/2025 following which he had symptomatic relief. Under CT guidance,14 Fr pigtail was placed into the peripancreatic collection and old pcd was removed on 21/8/2025. The pigtail drained around 100-200 ml necrotic fluid daily and later clear fluid (amylase- 10,7401, culture -sterile). NJ trial feed was started on 21/8/2025 which he tolerated and was increased as per tolerance. A CECT was done on 25/8/2025 and MRCP on 2/9/2025 which showed disconnected pancreatic duct. MGE opinion was taken for ERCP and PD stenting and is planned for the same on OPD basis . Pulmonary medicine opinion was taken on 8/9/2025 in view of mild tachypnoea and aspiration was done from right pleural cavity; it showed pus, and on 10/9 2025, 10 fr pigtail was placed under VIR into right pleural cavity which drain around 100 ml pus. ( Culture- K pneumoniae). PCD fluid was refed via NJ. Patient was given oral feed trial which he tolerated without any increase in PCD output. Hence NJ was removed on 13/9/2205 and he was started fully on oral diet. Pulmonary review was taken on 15/8/2025 and was advised to keep the PCD in situ in view of infected pleural fluid and discharge patient with ICD. He had high grade fever episodes on 17 and 18th September. He was started on oral antibiotics and usg was done (18/9/2025) which revealed no intra abdominal collection or pleural effusion. Fever settled after 2 days. Patient is currently being hemodynamically stable, tolerating soft diet, passing stool and flatus and is being discharged in stable condition. During hospital course he was managed with iv and oral antibiotics (meropenem, levofloxacin, cefuroxime) analgesics, antiemetics, antispasmodics, octreotide symptomatic and supportive care. Labs at the time of discharge; CBC- 9.5,8280,3.86l, crp-33, lipase- 26. Plan : ERCP PD stenting.

Currently patient is hemodynamically stable, ambulatory, afebrile, tolerating orals, passing flatus and motion, abdomen soft, non tender and hence being discharged in stable condition.\n\nOTHER INVESTIGATIONS: USG W/A(23/08/25,Outside)-LIVER-mildly enlarged,a well defined hypoechoic heterogenous mass lesion 2.1 cm is seen in periportal region with partial degeneration.There is clear fat plane between portal vein and the mass.minimal perihepatic fluid is seen.IMPRESSION;Hypoechoic lobulated lesion in periportal region with partial degeneration,query degenerative nodes.to correlate with mild hepatomegaly with mild perihepatic fluid is seen.to correlate with lab data.\n\nCECT Abdomen(26/08/25,Outside)-IMAGING FINDINGS: Situs inversus:The abdominal and thoracic organs are transposed. The liver is located on the left side, the spleen on the right side, and the cardiac apex is directed to the right, confirming situs inversus. Liver:The liver is mildly enlarged (mild hepatomegaly) but shows homogeneous enhancement. No focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary dilatation is seen.\n\nSpleen and Splenic Vein:The spleen is right-sided and appears normal in size. The splenic vein is occluded, with multiple collateral venous channels noted along the splenic hilum and perigastric region, consistent with collateral circulation due to chronic splenic vein thrombosis.\n\nPancreas:The pancreas is shrunken and irregular in outline with multiple coarse parenchymal calcifications. The main pancreatic duct is dilated up to 15 mm, consistent with chronic calcific pancreatitis. No peripancreatic fluid collection or acute inflammatory changes are seen.\n\n![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_2_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nPeritoneum:A small amount of free fluid is seen in the peritoneal cavity, consistent with mild ascites. Pleura:Minimal free fluid is present in the right pleural cavity, consistent with a minimal right pleural effusion. Lung Bases:The lung bases demonstrate multiple mucoid-impacted bronchioles, suggestive of chronic airway disease/bronchiectasis. Other abdominal organs:Gallbladder, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. No hydronephrosis, renal calculus, or adrenal lesion.\n\nUrinary bladder and prostate are unremarkable. Bowel loops show normal calibre and enhancement with no evidence of obstruction or perforation.\n\nNo significant retroperitoneal, mesenteric, or pelvic lymphadenopathy. Bones: Visualized bony structures show no destructive or sclerotic lesion.\n\nIMPRESSION: CECT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS REVEALS- SITUS INVERSUS WITH COMPLETE TRANSPOSITION OF ABDOMINAL AND THORACIC ORGANS.MILD HEPATOMEGALY.SPLENIC VEIN OCCLUSION WITH MULTIPLE PERISPLENIC AND PERIGASTRIC COLLATERAL VESSELS.

Patient consulted elsewhere and was admitted in multiple hospitals ,evaluated with imaging, diagnosed to have acute pancreatitis with intraabdominal collection, managed conservatively and got symptomatic relief. For almost 2 months, patient was symptom free following which patient started developing abdominal pain on & off, which required iv analgesics in between and was managed conservatively. History of fever on & off(no documentation available),currently c/o fever for 3 days, h/o significant weight loss present(~26 kgs in 6-7 months).No h/o jaundice or GI bleed. Patient consulted elsewhere for these complaints and currently consulted in SGE OPD and was admitted for further management. Recently diagnosed case of DM, on insulin for 3-4 months. Not a k/c/o HTN/TB/BA/CAD. He takes mixed diet, normal bladder & bowel habits. no significant family history. No addictions or known allergy.\n\nCASE SUMMARY: Patient conscious, oriented to time place and person, moderately built and nourished.\n\nHR- 112bpm,RR-18/min,BP-84/64mmHg,SPo2-99%,afebrile.weight-44.2kg,height-164cm,BMI-16.4kg/m2\n\nNo Pallor/ icterus /Edema/LN/Clubbing\n\nChest-b /l AE+,NVBS,CVS-s1s2 heard, CNS-NFND,\n\nP/A-soft, non tender, not distended, warmth+, no organomegaly, no ascites ,no scars\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Currently patient is hemodynamically stable, ambulatory, afebrile, tolerating orals, passing flatus and motion, abdomen soft, non tender and hence being discharged in stable condition.\n\n# FINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n\nAcute necrotising pancreatitis;\n\nSplenic vein thrombosis;\n\nDiabetes mellitus;\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Patient presented at SGE OPD with above mentioned complaints and was admitted for further management, Routine blood investigations were done (Hb-12.3, TLC-7660, TB-0.54, DB-0.14, SGOT/SGPT-38/31 ALP-214, TP/ALB- 6.8/3.3, Urea/creat \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 13.71/0.73, PT/INR-13.7/1.2, amylase/lipase-63/19). He was started on iv antibiotics. Endocrinology consultation was sought for management for Diabetes Mellitus and advice was followed. On 26th August, VIR Consultation was sought for Drainage of Collection, revealed no e/o obvious collection in peritoneal cavity. USG was done on 29/8/2025 and revealed no drainable collections. He became\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nafebrile and is currently asymptomatic. During hospital course, patient was managed conservatively with iv antibiotics (Meropenem), iv PPI, iv analgesics, IV antiemetics, and other symptomatic & supportive care.\n\nOTHER INVESTIGATIONS: USG W/A(17/02/2025,Outside) GB wall is thin and smooth, thickness is within normal limits. No sludge and calculi seen. Pancreas - appears bulky and heterogeneous with peripancreatic fat stranding and collection, s/o- possibility of acute pancreatitis.\n\nCECT WHOLE ABDOMEN (21.02.2025,Outside) Pancreas appears bulky, showing heterogeneous CT attenuation with poorly defined outlines. Multifocal nonenhancing hypodense areas are seen diffusely involving most of pancreas. Moderate inflammatory changes are seen in peripancreatic regions (in the form of inflammatory fat stranding) involving regions of gastrohepatic, gastrosplenic & splenorenal ligaments, extending inferiorly along bilateral anterior pararenal fascias, lateroconal fascias, upto paracolic gutters. No evidence of calcification is seen. Visualized MPD is not dilated. Adjacent walls of stomach & small as well as large bowel loops are showing variable reactionary mural thickening\n\nUSG W/A(21.03.2025,Outside):Pancreas appears bulky, shows heterogeneous echotexture and ill defined peripancreatic outlines. MPD is not dilated. There is evidence of mild inflammatory changes (in the form of inflammatory fat stranding and small fluid) seen involving peripancreatic areas. No significant collection pocket is seen. On color doppler examination, pancreas is showing minimal patchy vascularity. No obvious pseudocyst formation is noted on present\n\nUSG W/A (01/04/25,Outside):PANCREAS-bulky head, body & tail, Homogenous mass , f/c/o pancreatitis, normal pancreatic duct. CT - WHOLE ABDOMEN (CONTRAST)(30-06-2025,Outside)Large loculated low attenuation collection is seen in retroperitoneum, involving almost entire pancreas and extending into splenic hilum. Collection measures approx. 3.6 x 13.6 x 5.1cm. Mild inflammatory stranding is seen in peripancreatic region and lesser sac with mild thickening of left anterior pararenal fascia. Inflammatory thickening of gastric wall is seen.Multiple small subcentimeter sized discrete and non-necrotic mesenteric lymphnodes are seen, largest measuring approx. 09 x 14mm. CT severity index 4+4+2 = 10\n\nUSG W/A(12-08-2025,Outside) Visualized pancreas is replaced by a large heterogeneous sausage shaped non-liquefied phlegmonous collection of size 11 x 7 x 5 cm (volume approx. 150-200cc) - likely walled off necrotic collection. There is raised peripancreatic fat echogenicity with few vascular collaterals and diffuse gastric wall thickening - likely necrotizing pancreatitis sequelae. There is marked attenuation of porto-splenic confluence with non visualization of retropancreatic splenic vein - likely chronic venous thrombosis. Multiple discrete subcentimetric sized peripancreatic & retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen.Spleen: is normal in size (10.0 cm) and echotexture.\n\nCECT ABDOMEN & PELVIS(12.08.2025,Outside) Pancreas is bulky with peripancreatic fat stranding. Elongated collection of size 2.8 x 10 cms is seen along the length of pancreas within pancreas likely dilated MPD. Liver is normal in size 14cms and shows fatty infiltration (mean HU +57).Multiple fat necrosis nodules/lymph nodes are seen in surroundings in mesentery and in retroperitoneum. Reactive thickening and edema seen along C loops of duodenum with distended stomach. Splenic vein is not seen likely thrombosed and absorbed.\n\nUSG GUIDED FNAC(26.02.2025,Outside)Under strict aseptic precautions and USG guidance single pass was taken from pancreatic necrosis. Approx 04 cc of necrotic material was aspirated and sample handed over for C/S evaluations. No procedural complication was seen.\n\nUGIE(MAY 2025)-Esophagus-normal. Stomach-antral gastritis. Duodenum-normal.\n\nUSG W/A(29/08/25,AIIMS)LIVER-Borderline enlarged(15.7cm), IHBR nondilated, PV normal hepatopetal flow, Hepatic veins& intra hepatic IVC normal, Triangular area in segment 8 of liver showing less attenuation compared to surrounding liver parenchyma, with vessels traversing the area s/o focal fat sparing. GB-Thick edematous wall. CBD-proximal non dilated. SPLEEN- normal in shape, size & echotexture. PANCREAS: head-26mm,body-29mm,tail-31mm, appears slightly bulky with surrounding fat stranding & thin rim of peripancreatic free fluid & shows heterogenous echotexture.\n\n### ADVICE ON DISCHARGE:\n\nHigh protein low fat diet\n\n![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_2_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nTab MONTELEUKAST+ LEVOCETRIZINE HS x 7 days\n\nInj NPH S/C 12U at 8am, 6U at 10pm\n\nInj Regular Insulin S/C 6U Before Breakfast, 8U Before Lunch, 4U Before Dinner\n\nTab PANTOPRAZOLE 40mg OD x 7 days\n\nTab PARACETAMOL 500mg sos x 7 days\n\nReview in SGE OPD on Monday/Thursday after ct scan abdomen with NCCT films and report\n\nFollow up in endocrinology OPD for management of DM.\n\nTo monitor sugar levels at home as advised by endocrinology cx and watch for hypoglycemic symptoms.\n\nDISCHARGE BY : Dr Vishal Gupta\n\nDISCHARGE REMARKS :\n\nFOLLOW UP ON : 08-Sep-2025\n\nFOLLOW UP CONSULTANT / FACULTY : Dr Vishal Gupta\n\nFOLLOW UP ADVICE : Visit TEM OPD nearby hospital/ AIIMS in case of emergencies like pain abdomen/vomiting/abdominal\n\ndistension etc\n\nSummary Prepared By Summary Approved By\n\nDr Basil Babu Dr Vishal Gupta", "text_chars": 9186, "truncated": false}, "ayuesh-kirad-8a3fbe7359::bccfa6bd8885": {"patient_key": "ayuesh-kirad-8a3fbe7359", "patient_display_name": "Ayuesh Kirad", "study_id": "AP-SVT-001", "case_bucket": "active", "svt_status": "with_svt", "file_id": "bccfa6bd8885", "file_name": "Bacteriology.pdf", "relative_path": "02-Data-Collection/Active-Cases/Acute Pancreatitis cases with SVT/Ayuesh Kirad/Bacteriology.pdf", "category": "imaging", "mime_type": "application/pdf", "extension": ".pdf", "updated_at": "2025-11-24T17:54:41.988279+00:00", "size_bytes": 115410, "signature": "115410:1764006881988279372", "status": "indexed", "error": null, "extractor": "marker", "indexed_at": "2026-02-18T21:24:57.371665+00:00", "text": "![](_page_0_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n**Room/Bed** : Gastro Srg Ward Room/Bed 2\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\n## Department of Microbiology **Bacteriology ABHA NO** : - **ABHA ADDRESS** : kiradaayuesh28@abdm **CR No** : 239212502538461 **Lab/Study No.** : 250825MM151 **Coll./Study Date** : 25-Aug-25 13:30 **Patient Name** : Aayuesh Kirad **Age/Sex** : 20 Yr/M **Acceptance Date** : 25-Aug-25 20:16 **Sample Type/No** : Serum/250825MM151 **Ward** : Gastro Surgery Ward **Reporting Date** : 31-Aug-25 13:21 **Dept/Unit** : Surgical Gastroenterology\n\n| Investigation                | Result                                        | Unit | Ref.

Weight- 55.5kg ,height- 172 cm, BMI- 18.8 kg/m2 ,PR-78/min BP- 110/70 mmhg RR- 20 Spo2- 98% .On examination-Chest- normal breath sounds present ,P/A-Mild distension, no tenderness,no organomegaly\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Pt expired.\n\n### FINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n\nAcute on Chronic Pancreatitis\n\nWalled off necrosis\n\nSepsis\n\nLiver dysfunction\n\nContained duodenal leak\n\nRetroperitoneal hemorrhage\n\nShock\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)\n\nMODS\n\nPortal vein thrombosis;\n\nSplenic vein thrombosis;\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted to the SGE ward for above mentioned complaints. Necessary blood investigations were done. CECT abdomen done (16/9/25) revealed pancreatic necrosis & peripancreatic emphysematous collection. IVR consultation done and CT guided B/L PCDs were placed retroperitoneally for collections, which were draining 100-150ml of pus & necrotic material per day. Pt was planned for surgery (retroperitoneal debridement) in case of persistent sepsis. On 30/09/25, two additional PCDs were placed into B/L intra-abdominal collections on the anterior aspect. Pt then had enteric output from right sided drains. CECT abdomen done on 1/10/25, revealed contrast leak likely from the D3 segment of duodenum, leak resolved spontaneously. Pt developed respiratory distress with left pleural effusion, sudden onset tachycardia & respiratory alkalosis. SICU, MICU, Pulmonology and cardiology consultations were sought & necessary advice was followed. Gastromedicine consultation was done i/v/o deranged LFT & was diagnosed as hepatic dysfunction (possible sepsis induced) & pt was started on liver protective agents. MICU and SICU consultations were sought for further management and transfer, as the patient required ICU care. On 15/10/25, after correction of anemia & coagulopathy, after obtaining informed high-risk consent, sequential necrosectomy was done i/v/o poor GC. Initially left side pancreatic necrosectomy (VARD) under spinal anesthesia done (15/10/25). Pt was shifted to MICU (CCM). Pt developed respiratory distress with hypertension 16/10/25, pt was intubated & started on ionotropes. On 17/10/25, right necrosectomy (VARD). Post debridement, pt improved. Drainage were initially purulent with necrotic material but after about a week enteric output was noted on right sided drains. Pt needed prolonged ventilatory support & hence tracheostomy was done. Intermittent extubation trial were given but pt did not tolerate. Pt was managed with antibiotics (Ceftazidime avibactum, aztreonam, metronidazole & antifungal), NJ feeds & drain irrigation & other supportive care. For the past 4-5 days, pt had enteric output in left sided drains. urgent CT scan done with oral+NJ+rectal & iv contrast (provisional report NJ tube eroding distal duodenum & jejunum with tip in jejunum; Final report awaited). Hence pt was planned for emergency surgery after PT correction. On 6/11/25 at around 1.30 am pt had acute onset bleeding from both the peridrain site with fall in Hb, hypotension which required dual ionotrope support. Immediately 4 FFP & 1 PRBC transfusion. Urgent DSA / angioembolisation was planned, but pt condition rapidly deteriorated with severe acidosis, anuria & hence DSA could not be done. Patient then developed ventricular tachyarrythmia at around 11.30am on 6/11/25. Patient was resuscitated as per ACLS protocol and 3cycles of CPR given. In-spite of all the resuscitative measures, pt could not be revived & declared dead on 6/11/25 at 12.01 pm.\n\nOTHER INVESTIGATIONS: CECT abdomen(28/08/25,Outside)-f/s/o moderate to severe necrotising pancreatitis of ct score 8large peripancreatic fluid collection extending into bilateral pararenal, paracolic, illac fossae, greater and lesser sacs, compressing the pancreas, stomach, and small bowel loops.Largest dimensions: 9 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd 10 cm (right) and 8 x 10 cm (left).multifocal pancreatic necrosis with peripancreatic inflammation.

Patient consulted elsewhere for these complaints,\nevaluated with imaging. Patient then consulted in TEM, AIIMS Bhopal, where he was admitted & evaluated & managed conservatively\nand discharged. From there on patient has been having abdominal pain on & off, for which patient consulted in SGE OPD and was\nmanaged conservatively and was kept on follow up. But patient had persistent abdominal, hence patient was advised to consult in\nVIR where PCD was placed into the collection on 08/05/25. Initially PCD output was around 100-200 ml Pus per day, which started\nreducing gradually. Patient again consulted in VIR for assessment and PCD was removed on 19/08/25 in view of no obvious collection.\nNow for the past 3 days patient has been having fever & cough f/b pus discharge from PCD site since yesterday, so that now came to\nSGE OPD and admitted in SGE ward for further management.
